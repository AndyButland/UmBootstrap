# UmBootstrap

## Description
UmBootstrap is more than an Umbraco Starter Kit.
It is a comprehensive solution that offers a variety of layout templates and a rich component library to suit your needs.
At the heart of UmBootstrap is an Umbraco website containing sections and pages which are all created using well documented Umbraco techniques and structured using Bootstraps HTML and CSS. 
## Features
UmBootstrap Is comprised of page templates, section templates and a wide variety of components commonly found in my websites.
All of this is constructed using Umbraco doctypes and datatypes and Bootstrap HTML and CSS.
## Usage
UmBootstrap is designed to be used as a starter kit for building websites. It is not a theme or a package. It is a website that you can use as a starting point for your own website.
However, it is not a blank canvas. It is a fully functional website with a variety of page and section templates and a rich component library.
This is ideal if you are new to Umbraco and want to learn how to build websites using Umbraco and Bootstrap.
However, for more experienced developers, you may find that you want to remove some of the templates and components that you don't need or copy and paste the ones that you do need into your own website.
## Installation
The ideal way to install UmBootstrap is to use the UmBootstrap Visual Studio project template. This will create a new Umbraco website with UmBootstrap already installed.
